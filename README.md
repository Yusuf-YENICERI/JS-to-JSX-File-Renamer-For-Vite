# :file_folder: JS to JSX File Renamer for Vite

This Python script checks files in a specified folder and its subfolders for the presence of JSX code. If JSX code is found, it renames the file with the appropriate extension for Vite projects (`.tsx` for TypeScript and `.jsx` for JavaScript).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yusuf-YENICERI/JSX-TSX-Renamer-For-Vite.git```
   
2. Navigate to the script's directory:

```bash
cd JSX-TSX-Renamer-For-Vite
```

3. Run it

```bash
python rename.py
```

Make sure to have Python installed on your machine.

## Important Note
This script is designed for projects using Vite, where JSX files are needed. It identifies files with JSX code and renames them with the appropriate file extension based on the original extension (.ts to .tsx and .js to .jsx).

## Disclaimer
Use this script responsibly and always make a backup of your project before running it. The script may modify file names, and it's recommended to test it in a safe environment first.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.
